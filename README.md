# Aim:
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

# Procedure:
## Step 1: Choose the Content Type
Select the target output format:
1. Report
2. Article
3. Case Study
4. Creative Work (e.g., Story, Comic Script, etc.)

## Step 2: Apply Prompt Patterns
Use structured prompting techniques such as:
### 1. Query Decomposition:
Break a broad request into smaller, manageable sub-queries.
Example:
Instead of “Write a case study,” break it into:
1. What is the background?
2. What is the problem?
3. What was the solution?
4. What were the outcomes?
### 2. Decision-Making Prompts:
Add conditional phrasing.
Example:
“If the tone should be professional, use formal vocabulary. Else, use conversational language.”
### 3. Semantic Filtering:
Specify tone, vocabulary, audience, or structure constraints.
Example:
“Generate a 500-word article in journalistic tone, targeted at startup founders, avoiding technical jargon.”
### 4. Role-Based Prompting:
Ask the model to act in a specific role.
Example:
“Act as a marketing strategist and write a case study on a failed product launch.”
### 5. Iterative Prompt Refinement:
Review content and adjust the prompt to improve structure or clarity.
Example:
“Now rewrite the introduction to include a compelling hook and background.”
### 6. Template-Based Prompting:
Use predefined structures for standard content formats.
Example for a Report:
1. Title:
2. Introduction:
3. Objectives:
4. Methodology:
5. Findings:
6. Conclusion:

# Example Execution (Fictional Dialogue):
### Prompt using Role Assignment & Constraints:
"Write a fictional dialogue between a curious teenager and a humanoid robot explaining the importance of renewable energy, limited to 250 words and written in a friendly tone."

# Result :  
The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
